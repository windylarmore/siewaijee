                            <p> Whenever I go to the driver download page, there are a lot of half mini cards, I cannot understand which one to run. Like this link: Which one to download from here? https://imgur.com/a/Z6Zp6vB Edit: SOLVED Installing this : Intel® Centrino® Wireless-N 1030 driver solved the problem. i recently had to reinstall windows 7 on my dell latitude e6400 32bit(purchased online through amazon refurbished) and after the installation my wifi wasnt wasnt working, i went found that the wireless network drivers were not functioning an mustve been wiped during the installion, i currently have it connected through the ethernet access but i want my wifi an i have been searching all over the internet looking for the right driver and have not yet to find the correct ones, if anyone could. Hey everyone, I'm a high schooler and I recently built my very first computer. The only computers I've had in my house before are the family Mac with an i5 and some laptops with no better than i5 processors either, and never anything with a graphics card. Here's my part list: CPU: Intel - Core i7-8700K 3.7 GHz 6-Core Processor (5.99 @ Amazon) CPU Cooler: be quiet! - Dark Rock 4 CPU Cooler (.90 @ Amazon) Motherboard: Gigabyte - Z390 AORUS PRO WIFI ATX LGA1151 Motherboard (4.99. Just wanted to give some impressions and thoughts about Fedora 30 for anyone curious out there maybe thinking of trying the beta. As a bit of background, I built my desktop in 2015 when I wasn't even really aware of what was going on with Linux. I'd tried it before but I always had some hardware issues or something. Unbeknownst to me, these issues were really caused by me, for choosing an Nvidia card and a Broadcom-based Wifi card. But like I said, I was pretty ignorant. If I had known about. I'm currently on High Sierra, 10.13.6. Things seem to be working so far, for the most part. Details: - I used /u/corpnewt's new guide (https://hackintosh.gitbook.io/-r-hackintosh-vanilla-desktop-guide/), pretty well verbatim. Thanks for the guide; the example `config.plist` file is very useful! - I use FileVault2 encryption. - Specific set up - Clover v2.4k_r4918 - config.plist - `iMac18,3` SMBIOS info - Add boot arg: `slide=0` - Motherboard/BIOS settings - Set defaults. 
Hi all, I recently have a new Thinkpad A285. The form and performance of the machine is great, but I'm noticing that the power draw is higher-than-should-be. When I run `powertop`, I get an average power draw of 11 Watts while idle (i.e., screen brightness at 5%, not doing anything besides). Simply opening up a browser window is enough to spin the fans. In this review (https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-A285-Ryzen-5-Pro-Vega-8-FHD-Laptop-Review.391526.0.html) the average power. Firstly, here are the components: PCPartPicker part list (https://pcpartpicker.com/list/X2YXcY) / Price breakdown by merchant (https://pcpartpicker.com/list/X2YXcY/by_merchant/) Type Item Price :---- :---- :---- CPU Intel - Core i7-8700K 3.7 GHz 6-Core Processor (https://pcpartpicker.com/product/sxDzK8/intel-core-i7-8700k-37ghz-6-core-processor-bx80684i78700k) 9.99 @ Newegg CPU Cooler Noctua - NH-D15 82.5 CFM CPU Cooler (https://pcpartpicker.com/product/4vzv6h/noctua-cpu. I can connect to ethernet just fine but I can't connect to my home wifi and it just does it for my wifi, not anyone else it worked on my phone hotspot as well so i am so very confused I've tried different drivers and still nothing and I am currently running windows 7 although I've tried windows vista both (32 bit) and im looking to try any thing. Hello there, I'm trying to buy a new pc from scratch and my main goal is that my build has to be 100% compatible with linux, so no privative drivers needed (or the lesser the better) and a great linux user community per component. The only restriction I have is that I want to use AMD for the CPU and the graphic card. It would be great to mount only ethically built parts, but I think this is like a fantasy nowadays in the pc parts industry, but if someone has some thoughts about this, it could. So I'm on a windows 7 desktop. This has been going on for a few weeks but I assumed it was my shit ISP never providing the speeds we pay. Started to go to all my wireless and wired devices and see they constantly get over 100-150Mbps. Latency is not an issue at ~25ms, just cant get much higher than 32-33Mbps. System info: Windows 7, all updates, PIA vpn(disabled and off), PC built from parts i5/24GB/r9 390/SSDs A bit of what I've done Safe mode with networking = ~32Mbps tested About six month ago I received my XPS15-9570, with a i7 gen 8 processor, 32 GB of RAM, 1 TB of Nvme storage, GTX 1050 Ti Max-Q graphics and 4K touchscreen. My expectations were quite high, especially for a 3000 dollar laptop. In this review, I'll explain what I enjoy in this laptop and some of the disappointments I had with it. And I'll give some advice that might help people who have bought this laptop or are considering buying it. On paper, the XPS15's specs are outstanding Hey guys, I'm thinking of two paths to going down for my first hackintosh. I just want some help making up my mind. Before I forget to mention I want to dual boot, because I like playing a lot of PC games. Money isn't a issue and I don't really need the portability. I'm just looking for consistence performance and reliability since I'm mostly using Mojave for IOS and OSX development. The first and more cheaper path is that I can buy a better ssd and compatible FOR ANYONE HAVING TROUBLE, UPDATE TO BIOS VERSION 1.18. (THE LATEST ONE) Thanks /u/ltRnl If you enjoyed this guide, and have some spare change, feel free to help a broke high school student out! :D Thanks! https://www.paypal.me/DarrenPan (https://www.paypal.me/DarrenPan) This guide is currently for the i7 US model with MX150. Although other models will most likely work, there may be some tweaks. I will continue to update this guide for the i5 Model Currently researching a new workstation build and looking for advice about compatibility with linux. I intend to run Ubuntu as the OS. I need a machine for development. I do Java and C compiling and a lot of container and VM development. I need to be able to run up to 3x 2CPU/4GB VMs simultaneously OR several docker containers without any trouble. I shouldn't need to run both VMs and containers at the same time though. I also intend to do some light gaming with some of my office.

Normal Gaming @ 1440p Hello, I've recently been having a problem where when any application or software uses high download speeds from my network, my computer will start freezing/locking up every few seconds and audio will start stuttering constantly until I either cap the download speed to about 10 MB/s or pause/stop whatever is using the network. For the record, I am using a wired ethernet connection of 1 Gbps and have not checked if this happens over WiFi as my WiFi would not be able to achieve speeds This is a rather big one. I'm trying to clean out my closet and I'd rather get rid of this stuff than have to put it back in the closet. That being said, I think I'm asking reasonable prices. If not, let's talk and maybe we can make a deal. Finally, shipping is a pain in the ass and not cheap so something things are bundles and there are no exceptions. I'm in the US and I'm only going to ship US. If you're in Southern AZ (specifically Tucson), we can meet up and do a cash transaction I use my laptop at many places, and usually I need to use my mobile data connection for internet. USB tethering used to work perfectly, but for some reason, it doesn't work anymore, or works sometimes and then stops working again. This is what is supposed to happen, when it works: I plug my phone to my computer with the USB cable The phone identifies the connection and sets it to charge only mode The ADB notification pops up saying it's connected I activate USB Tethering on the quick. # Context I'm a professional. I'm a gamer. But I'm not a professional gamer  I tend to buy a new laptop about every 2 years, and recently I've maintained one thin-and-light laptop (currently a 13" Macbook Pro) and one laptop powerful enough for AAA gaming. I also have a gaming desktop, but I'm seriously trying to find a way to ditch it. Soon  My dream is total convergence (one laptop for everything, no desktop). A few things about me that influenced my decision to buy the Razer Blade.
